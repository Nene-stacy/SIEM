Security monitoring with Wazuh 
Introduction:
Wazuh is an open source tool for security monitoring and threat detection, log analysis, file integrity monitoring, compliance monitoring and even vulnerability detection. Wazuh is a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) that fits seamlessly with Elastic Stack (ELK) to provide log analysis tools and visualization.
Wazuh is a valuable/powerful open source tool and can be utilized by everyone. Note with the emerging level of threats and cyber attacks, setting up your own SIEM is a great idea.
